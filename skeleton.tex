\section*{Basic LaTeX functionalities}

This document is as plain as it gets. But you do have page numbering.

Here's an equation:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
    \label{eq:gaussian_integral}
\end{equation}

And here's a table:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        $x$ & $f(x)$ \\
        \hline
        1 & 2 \\
        2 & 4 \\
        3 & 6 \\
        4 & 8 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A simple table}
    \label{tab:simple_table}
\end{table}
Notice that it's positioned to be exactly here using the \texttt{[H]} in the
beginning line. Otherwise, it would float to the top of the page (or the next
suitable page).

The code for the Imperial logo comes here, but it floats to the top of the page.
Notice that it's set to be 60\% of the width of the writable page 
(\texttt{[width=0.6\textbackslash textwidth]}).
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/imperial.pdf}
    \caption{Imperial College London logo}
    \label{fig:imperial_logo}
\end{figure}

I can reference each of these elements using the \texttt{label} command. For
example, I can reference the table as Table \ref{tab:simple_table}, the equation
as Equation \ref{eq:gaussian_integral}, and the figure as Figure
\ref{fig:imperial_logo}.

If I want to include a multiline equation, I can use the \texttt{align} 
environment:
\begin{align}
    1+1+1+1+1&=2+1+1+1 \nonumber\\
    &=3+1+1 \\
    &=4+1 \nonumber\\
    &=5
\end{align}
I put \texttt{\textbackslash nonumber} in the lines I don't want to be numbered.

To include code, I can use the \texttt{lstlisting} environment. But this can
go into a new \texttt{\textbackslash subsection}, that I decide to number:

\subsection{Including code}

Wait! The number is all weird. I'd prefer it to be \texttt{1.1} instead of
\texttt{0.1}. Let's fix this by telling LaTeX that we are already in the first
section, using the \texttt{stepcounter} command.
\stepcounter{section}
But we also want to reset the subsection counter to 0. We can do this using the
\texttt{setcounter} command.
\setcounter{subsection}{0}
Let's see if this worked.

\subsection{Including code}

Yay! Onto displaying code.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Python example]
# This is a comment
import numpy as np

def inc(x):
    return x + 1

print(inc(4))
\end{lstlisting}
This can be used to include code from any language. I can include C code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
and (for whatever reason) I even removed the caption!

I can also include code from a file:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Python example from file]{
    ./code/example.py
}

Now that's done, let's draw something using TikZ.

\subsection{Drawing with TikZ}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}

        \draw[fill=yellow] (0,0) circle (1);
        \draw (0,0) circle (1);
        \draw (-0.5,0.5) circle (0.1);
        \draw (0.5,0.5) circle (0.1);
        \draw (-0.5,-0.5) -- (0.5,-0.5);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A simple vector graphic face.}
    \label{fig:tikz_2d}
\end{figure}

But maaybe you generated some data and saved it as a \texttt{.csv} file. You can
include a plot of this too!

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            title={Data Plot},
            xlabel={$x$},
            ylabel={$f(x)$},
            legend pos=north west,
            ymajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
        ]
        \addplot table [x=x, y=y, col sep=comma] {./code/data.csv};
        \addlegendentry{Data}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A simple plot of some data.}
    \label{fig:tikz_plot}
\end{figure}

Finally, some useful LaTeX commands and maths stuff, like matrices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\textbackslash textbf\{bold\}}: \textbf{bold}
    \item \texttt{\textbackslash textit\{italic\}}: \textit{italic}
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        7 & 8 & 9
    \end{bmatrix}=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        7 & 8 & 9
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\end{document}
